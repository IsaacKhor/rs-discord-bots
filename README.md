# A collection of helpful runescape discord bots

This repo contains:

1. `noodlebot`: a bot to keep track of wildywyrm worlds (DEPRECATED)
2. `tierbot`: a small bot used to keep track of namelists (DEPRECATED)
3. `wbunotify`: WBU FC's notification bot
4. `worldbot`: WBU FC's main warbands bot

`worldbot` run instructions:

1. Clone somewhere `git clone https://github.com/IsaacKhor/rs-discord-bots`
2. Configure the script with the correct parameters, they are at the top
   of the file and are fairly self-explanatory (host, port, etc)
3. Run the script `./worldbot-discord.py <discord-token>`

Help can be found by running the `.guide` command.
