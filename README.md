# Worldbot, the TS and discord bot designed for Warbands

1. Clone somewhere (repo has submodules) `git clone --recurse-submodules https://github.com/IsaacKhor/worldbot`
2. Install requirements (`blinker`, install with `pip3 install blinker`)
3. Configure the script with the correct parameters
4. Run the script `./worldbot-ts3.py <password-for-serverquery-acc>`

The TS bot requires a ServerQuery account with permissions to receive and send
textmessages. I would not recommend giving it an admin account just in case
it messes something up.
