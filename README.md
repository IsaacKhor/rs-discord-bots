# Worldbot, the TS and discord bot designed for Warbands

1. Clone somewhere `git clone https://github.com/IsaacKhor/worldbot`
1. Configure the script with the correct parameters, they are at the top
   of the file and are fairly self-explanatory (host, port, username, password,
   etc.)
4. Run the script `./worldbot-ts3.py <password-for-serverquery-acc>`

The TS bot requires a ServerQuery account with permissions to receive and send
textmessages. I would not recommend giving it an admin account just in case
it messes something up.
